      <p>  I took two semester long courses focused on Computer Science in my sophomore year at Lick-Wilmerding High School.
        Computing 1 is a semester-long Techincal Arts course offered at LWHS (Lick-Wilmerding). In the class, we learned about
      the basics of computer science through Scratch and p5 (javascript). In many of our projects, we interwove art with computer programming,
      demonstrating how coding is filled with creativity and self-expression. We generated visual art, designed textiles, created animations,
      made custon software, and physically fabricated our designs on machines like the laser cutter, 3d printer, and CNC mill. Through all our projects,
      we developed a strong foundation in computer science concepts.

     <br> <br> Computing 2 PPP (Public Purpose Program) is another semester-long Technical Arts course offered at LWHS that has a
     community focused aspect. In this class, we continued to deepen our understanding of computer science. We also focused more on what computers are,
   learning about binary, the history of the computer, digital logic, memory, and more. We were able to have a lot more freedom with this course- we
 were able to choose a programming language research and use to make a project of our choice.

   <br> <br> In both classes, we  practiced collaboration; many of our large projects required that we work in group or pairs, preparing us for the culture
    at jobs where people work in teams to create awesome products. In our final project,to fulfill the PPP aspect, we were tasked to make a website
    or app that would benefit the community. We had to learn a lot about UI/UX, communication with clients and overall planning.</p>

      <p> For this project, we were prompted to design and program a digital learning app that enables a learner to explore a topic of our choice. We were required to include:
        Objects, HTML / User Interface Elements, data/APIs, and/or sound. <br>
        Because I was learning about the industrialization in history class, I decided to make an RPG game that is about the life of a worker in a factory during the industrialization. The player has to choose what to sacrifice (time, money, happiness, or health).
        Each action they choose either deducts or adds to one of those things and they are trying to not get to zero on any of them or else it would lead to death.
        It shows how during the industrialization, working class people didn't really have a chance of a happy life or a rich life because they were never paid enough
        and they had to work for long hours, which caused many health problems. <br>

    <p>I found out how buttons work and how to make it so that clicking a button changes the value that is shown.
      I also learned how each button has its own function and my code is probably gonna end up really long. I originally
      had a problem making it so that the values would refresh every time I clicked a button. With the help of Ms. Freed,
      I learned that I had to redo the background every time.

    <p><br> I was able to change my code so that there would be four values rather than just one. Thanks to Cal,
      I learned how to make my code so that when if one of the values was going to become negative when a certain button was pressed,
      nothing would happen. So now I don't have to worry that the time would go to negative and I can apply this to when (for example)
      the health goes down to O and a certain action happens when this is true. I was also able to come up with different scenarios.

    So I came up with the intro/context and the next day and restart button. I made a restart button that would restart everything as well
    as a value that would count how many days went by. I also made it so that when the time goes down to zero, it shows "next day" and then
    resets the time and counts a day that passed. I just need to make something to track the highest score (most days).

    I made a page that shows achievements ( like they reach 100+ money or 200+ happiness). I also made it so that
    you could go back to the menu and if you did, you would not have to restart. I am halfway through the achievements.
    The moment you reach that achievement, a text shows it then disappears. I just have to make it so that it keeps track of which achievements
    you have already gotten and display it on the achievements page.

    I was able to debug my code. With the help of Ms. Freed, I found out that the reason my buttons kept on showing was
    because I was constantly making more. Also, I did my achievements!!!. I have, in total, 6 achievements and I was able
    to have the code track which achievements have already been achieved and display those on the achievements page. Also,
    I made it so that the achievement would keep popping up after every time it was achieved. For example, if my achievement
    is 200+ happiness and I achieve it at 200, and I press a button and I get a 205 happiness, the achievement won't show up again.

      <img class = "gameImg" src = "images/parametric.png">
      <p> For this project, we were required to work in groups to write a program that generates a parametric (customizable) 3D or 2D object using OpenJSCAD,
        a parametric modeling library for Javascript. The project had to have 4 user-editable parameters. <br> <br>
      We decided to make a customizable bracelet with a customizable metal plate.
      We didn't want to do the geometric shape bracelet challenge because we wanted to have two components/ materials to work with.
      We ended up making a leather bracelet with a customizable width and length with a small engraved shape on the side.
      Also, we made a metal plate with a customizable width and length and words. <br> <br>
      Some challenges for the metal plate was that the words didn't have the same center as the metal plate itself.
      As a result, it was always kinda offset. We weren't able to find a solution for that because we encountered the problem a class before it was due.
      Also, our code originally didn't allow our 'words' to be differenced from the 'plate'. It was hard to troubleshoot and find out why our code was not working.
      Eventually, we were able to change the parameters so that it was restricted and the words would 'difference'.
      A challenge for the leather bracelet was cutting out designs. It was a struggle to find the exact points at which the designs were to be cut out of the leather.
      Also, at the beginning, union and difference weren't working and kept saying that "a[i].colorset" wasn't a function,
      but we found out that we had set up the wrong dimensions. We used "square" to difference, or "subtract"  the bracelet instead of "cube". <br>
      Also, we didn't know that we had to keep our design as a 2d file when using the mill and laser cutter.
      As a result, we had to change a lot of our code. Therefore, we weren't able to have the words, because "vector_text" has to be 3d or else it will
      not work with the code. Eventually, Ms. Freed helped us with the code by cutting it and making it 2d. </p>

      <p> For this project, we used P5 Javascript to write a program that generates a design to print on fabric, then use that fabric to make something. </p>
      <p>I wanted to make a  code where it places flower designs (that are random sizes and colors) in random locations. I was inspired by this image of a peony flower.
        In China, Peony flowers represent wealth, beauty, peace, and distinction. It is often referred to as the Queen of flowers.
        There is no designated date of when it originated. Also, red peonies are the most desired and valued while white peonies symbolize youth, wit, and beauty. <br> <br>
        I made a ruffled apron out of eco canvas for my mother. I used my programmed textile design for the bodice and skirt and used a light teal color for the straps and ruffle.
        We used the website, Sprout, to print our designs on our fabric and also get the pattern for the apron design.
        I learned that there are a lot of different stitches and that each fabric has a different needle and ironing setting. <br>
       Because his garment was so large and had so many parts, I was only able to sew the four straps (2 sided) and the bodice (2 sided).
       I ended up had hand-sowing the straps on because there wasn't much room to work on the table. It also took a lot of time to iron out the straps, because they
        were so thin and they kept on puffing up.</p>

        <p>I found the range of randomness of the colors for the flower as well as the size,
          but the translation doesn't seem right. It keeps on forming all the smaller flowers in
          the top left corner and all the large flower in the bottom right corner.</p>

          that my flowers aren't actually generated from the center of each flower. I am quite happy with this,
