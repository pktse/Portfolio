      <p>  I took two semester long courses focused on Circuits and Electronics in my sophomore year at Lick-Wilmerding High School.
        Circuits and Electronics: Analog and Digital is a semester-long Techincal Arts course offered at LWHS (Lick-Wilmerding). In the class, we
        learned about the basic skills to design and build an analog and digital (programmable) circuit using Arduino. We created an amplifier/speaker and researched
         how the shape of our speakers and the material we used affects the resonance and sound quality of our speakers. We were able to choose to add
         certain features that would make the project more difficult- I chose to add a petrometer, two tweeters, and a bluetooth. We also programmed
         an audio visualizer using a microcontroller that took in an audio input, analysed the audio, and outputed some code that controlled an LED
          matrix grid panel.

     <br> <br> Circuits and Electronics: Device Invention is another semester-long Technical Arts course offered at LWHS. In this class, we continued to
      develop our skills with designing and building electronic devices and circuits. We learned about data visualization, API, and other topics. For
      our data visualization project, our group chose to make a data visualization for a chemistry project we had. It was kinda like a science fair project
      and we had to find a way to display our data. As a result, we ended up making an interactive chart that showed the ideal environment for yeast growht.
      We were able to have a lot more freedom in this class; we were able to choose what our many of our projects would be. For our internet-connected project,
      I chose to make a display (in a small acrylic box) with the Arduino screen that displayed the temperature, weather, and date of that day. In addition, there
      was a button that would switch between screens so that you would also be able to see the MUNI (public transportation) times for my bus stop.
       <br> <br>
      In all our projects from these two classes, we learned the importance of time management, perserverance and prototyping. Through time management, we
      were able to make sure that our projects would actually get done on time. Perserverance was super important, especially when we had to trouble-shoot
      our code or look for small mistakes in our circuits.

         <p> This project took most of the semester. Using resistors, transistors, capacitors, inductors, LEDs, speakers, tweeters, and wires, we created a speaker. I also decided
          to add a bluetooth component so that I would be able to control my speaker remotedly.  <br> We began our project by looking over schematics and trying out those schematics on a breadboard.
         After we go it to work on the breadboard, we began soldering on our actual Arduino circuit board. Though I was able to sum up this process in two sentences, the actual process took around 2-3 weeks.
        After our circuits were finished, we began working on the enclosure. I decided to go with a simple geometric diamond shape. Using the laser cutter, I cut 1/2 inch MDF into the right sizes. Then, I
       went to the wood shop and used the edge sander to get the right angles so that the pieces would line up. When the enclosure was finished, I put the circuit board into the enclosure and secured the power jacket,
     potentiometer, speakers, and tweeters. </p> <br>

       <p>It was easy to read the schematics, but it originally didn't work because I didn't put the right capacitors. Also, I didn't use the amplifier Ic, instead I used the part where you are to put the amplifier Ic into.

       <h4> 10/27/16 </h4>
       <p>I, with the help of Mr. Kleindolph, was able to troubleshoot my circuit board and found where my error was. I soldered my wires to the wrong pin and also soldered my positive
         to negative by accident, which caused a short circuit. I also began to laser cut out my pieces of mdf on the large laser cutter. </p>

       <h4> 11/10/16 </h4>
       <p>I was able to find all the different angles and match it up so that it would fit together. Unfortunately, there were many gaps between the bottom piece and the trapezoids. Also, I finished adding all the screw holes for the speakers.
         I also removed the material so that the different components could fit through the hole. </p>

         <p> For our data visualization project, I decided to use this oppurtunity to connect two of my classes- chemistry and circuits. In our chemistry class, we were given
          a project to create a poster project on anything- like a science project! We, as a group, decided to create an interactive data visualization graph to display our results.
          <br> We created an interactive data vis/ graph based on source codes from d3 and c3. It showed the CO2 production (over the 900 seconds) for 5 different temperatures:
          35, 40, 45, 50, 55. You can look at each individual value by rolling your mouse over the lines. <br> We used our sensor to measure the respiration of yeast when heated at
           different temperatures with water and sugar as a collaboration with our Chemistry class. We learned how to visualize data using a rollover interactive graph and also how
           to connect through an arduino particle. This data could be used to establish an ideal temperature for letting dough rise to make bread or other sweet treats.</p>

         <p> In this project, we had to design a device that communicates over one of the following protocols: Radiofrequency, Wifi, Bluetooth, or SMS.
           During the process of making this project, we discussed the implications of an increasingly connected world. <br> <br> For my project, I decided to make a screen
          that displayed the weather, temperature and MUNI (public transportation) time for my stop using weather and MUNI API's. To switch between the different screens, I would press the big black button on top of
         the box. The enclosure was built from acrylic. I used a Photon Particle and Adafruit to connect my screen to the internet. </p>

         <p> For this project, we had to design a small portable solar device and understand the requirements for a basic solar charging system. <br> I decided to create a charging station-
          the enclosure was laser cut 1/8 MDF. Inside the enclosure was a charging unit, rechargable lithium battery and basic circuit board. The circuit connected to the solar panel which was conencted
        to the top of the enclosure. </p>
