      <p>  I took two semester long courses focused on Circuits and Electronics in my sophomore year at Lick-Wilmerding High School.
        Circuits and Electronics: Analog and Digital is a semester-long Techincal Arts course offered at LWHS (Lick-Wilmerding). In the class, we
        learned about the basic skills to design and build an analog and digital (programmable) circuit using Arduino. We created an amplifier/speaker and researched
         how the shape of our speakers and the material we used affects the resonance and sound quality of our speakers. We were able to choose to add
         certain features that would make the project more difficult- I chose to add a petrometer, two tweeters, and a bluetooth. We also programmed
         an audio visualizer using a microcontroller that took in an audio input, analysed the audio, and outputed some code that controlled an LED
          matrix grid panel.

     <br> <br> Circuits and Electronics: Device Invention is another semester-long Technical Arts course offered at LWHS. In this class, we continued to
      develop our skills with designing and building electronic devices and circuits. We learned about data visualization, API, and other topics. For
      our data visualization project, our group chose to make a data visualization for a chemistry project we had. It was kinda like a science fair project
      and we had to find a way to display our data. As a result, we ended up making an interactive chart that showed the ideal environment for yeast growht.
      We were able to have a lot more freedom in this class; we were able to choose what our many of our projects would be. For our internet-connected project,
      I chose to make a display (in a small acrylic box) with the Arduino screen that displayed the temperature, weather, and date of that day. In addition, there
      was a button that would switch between screens so that you would also be able to see the MUNI (public transportation) times for my bus stop.
       <br> <br>
      In all our projects from these two classes, we learned the importance of time management, perserverance and prototyping. Through time management, we
      were able to make sure that our projects would actually get done on time. Perserverance was super important, especially when we had to trouble-shoot
      our code or look for small mistakes in our circuits.
