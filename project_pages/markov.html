            <p> Having taken a music class and discrete maths/probability class, I wanted to combine what I had learned
              and implement a program that scans an inputted MIDI melody, generates a Markov model, and
              composes a melody based on the Markov model. Using Java and Midi, I was able to successfully create a
              program that would generate a melody based on an inputted melody.
              <br> <br> I was able to write a paper about the results of the Markov Model,
              asking people to guess if a melody was written by the program depending on the order of the markov
              model (ie. 3rd order versus 5th order markov chain). While not always successful, I found that a
              a 5th order markov chain was able to generate a melody that was able to fool some participants into
              thinking that it was written by a person.
