  <p>   Metal Fabrications: Kinetics is a semester-long Techincal Arts course offered at Lick-Wilmerding High School.
    I took this class during the fall semester of my junior year at LWHS (Lick-Wilmerding). In the class, we learned about
  pneumatics, hydraulics, and simple machines like levers and pulleys. This class mainly focused on the mechanics of motion,
  looking at concepts like gears, cams, levers, and linkages, and taught me how I could use these to create mechanical advantage.
Not only did I learn a lot, but I was also able to have a lot of freedom with many of the choices I made - I chose what materials to work with,
what concepts I wish to use, and what final project I wanted to complete. For every project, I was required to design and create each assigment while following a schedule
that I assigned myself. Because this course is so focused on kinetics and motion, I was able to apply what I learned in my physics course into the
designing phase of my assignments.</p>

    <p> For our pinewood derby car project, we were put into pairs to make the fastest derby car in the class. My partner and I decided to create a Pinewood Derby from a block of redwood, dowel, and MDF. <br>
    <br> We spent one class researching designs and watching videos where other people made derby cars and talked about what made a derby car fast. Using what we learned, we spent to rest of the class
   sketching out rough drafts and ideas.The next class, we shared and picked an idea and began building. We spent the next two classes cutting, sanding, and putting our derby car together.
   Next class, we raced our derby cars. Though our derby car did not win, it placed 3rd. </p>

    <img class = "gameImg" src = "images/kinetics/ramp.png">
    <p> For pneumatics, hydralics, and linkages projects, my partner and I were prompted to create a machine that would go up a metal ramp and knock down a pile of blocks.
      We spent two classes designing and researching and five classes building and testing. <br> <br>
      Overall, our project and time management was pretty successful. We worked our best to be efficient and get as much done so that in case something broke,
      we would still have extra time to finish it. We were also pretty fair when it came to distributing the work;
      for example, while I was designing things on rhino, Marc would be cutting out pieces of wood.
      We would also constantly be checking in with each other to know what we should do next. I feel like we could have spent a
      little more time designing and prototyping; we spent one class designing and even then, it was not a very well thought out design.
      The design did not take into account how inclined the slope was and it didn’t really consider all the different factors;
      we just chose the design because we believed it would be the one that would most likely succeed at the task. We didn’t really
      plan a lot, we just jumped into it. Once we chose a design and somewhat determined the final idea, we just gave ourselves a
      task and once we finished, we worked on the next one till it was done. I think that we were really efficient at making our design.
      We were also smart in picking a design that would not be too difficult to make and not have much workload, but I think we fell short
      in our actual designing process. Because we didn’t spend time thinking about all the different factors and scenarios that could
      hinder our success, it was not very well-designed and had a hard time  making it up the ramp.
      <br> <br>
      For our project, we chose to use linkages and pneumatics. We used a bell crank which can change the angel of motion (input, output) to move the wheels. We then
      used pneumatics to move linkages and to lift the machine up and down to reset the syringe that will move the linkage.

    <p> For our final projects, we were tasked to create anything we wanted as long as we applied one of the following materials we learned from class. I decided
    to create a kinetic sculpture that used gears. It would also have multiple CNC parts (laser cut), and be motor-driven. I used MDF, clear acrylic, acrylic dowell, and a motor.

  <h2> Logs: </h2>
  <h4> 10/24/17 </h4>
  <p>I have finished checking all the sizes and holes for the gears and I have begun building. I also finished getting and cutting
    my MDF boards so that I can start laser cutting, and I found my motor.
  </p>

  <h4> 10/26/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I tried to laser cut my pieces. Unfortunately, I found that I had wasted all my time because the laser cutter
    was not strong enough to cut all the way through the board; I couldn’t use the other laser cutters because people were in line to use them.
    In addition, I found out that my spacers were too small to laser cut; I will probably just 3d print them. Also,
    Giles told me that I would have to make a model which I originally did not intend on doing so I have to change my schedule.

  </p>
  <img style = "width: 70%; padding: 1px; border-radius: 0%; border: 1px solid rgb(19,124,165);" src = "images/kinetics/log2.png">
    <br>
  <hr>

  <h4> 10/27/17 (Free block) </h4>
  <p>I decided to use the full spectrum laser cutter. As a result, it was a lot faster than the 25 watt epilog laser cutter.
    By the end of the block, I had finished cutting out all my pieces (in MDF). I noticed that the pieces were all cut at a slight
    diagonal (laser error) and so I might need to adjust the placements of some gears if it’s way too close to other gears.
  </p>

    <br>
  <hr>

  <h4> 10/30/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I did my model and I realised that I would take a lot longer than I thought it would because it
    didn’t run as smoothly as I expected it to. Also, I might remove or scale down some gears and maybe move the
    axis around. I still have to print the acrylic and I also forgot one of the inbetween layers.

  <hr>

  <h4> 11/3/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I found out how much acrylic I would need. I also decided that
    I would use ⅜ inch spacers which would let the gears have more room and hopefully reduce the tripping.
  </p>

  <h4> 11/7/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I got my materials (¼ and ⅛ clear acrylic). I cut my ⅛ inch acrylic to the size
    that would fit into the laser cutter. In addition, I have determined that the spacers should clear
    up my problem. As a result, I plan to start building next class.

  <hr>

  <h4> 11/9/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I decided that I would shrink all the holes in my design so that I could use a drill to
     make the hole (so that it is straight). Also, I have cut my ¼ in acrylic into pieces that would fit
     into the laser cutter. Also, I finished cutting out the piece that I needed from the ⅛ inch acrylic.

  <hr>

  <h4> 11/13/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I got the spacers and replaced my laser-cut MDF ¼ inch spacers with the plastic ⅜ inch spacers.
    It immediately worked better. There were a few spacers that I had to sand down so that it would not get
    in the way of the gears (since the plastic spacers are wider). I plan to start cutting out my final acrylic pieces next class.

  <h4> 11/15/17 (PPP Day) </h4>
  <p>Today, I started to cut out my pieces from the ¼ inch clear acrylic.
    I also made 2x the amount of gears I need incase I accidentally break one or lose one.
    I still have to cut out my metal dowels and my ⅛ inch spacers. I also have to drill in
    the holes so that they are straight and not cut at an angle.

  <h4> 11/17/17 </h4>
  <p>I finished cutting all my gears and outer pieces. I also finished cutting the rods/
    metal dowels. I still have to drill the holes so that they are cut at a right angle
    (since it is cut at a slight angle because of the laser cutter) and I need to cut out my ⅛ in spacers.

  <h4> 11/21/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I finished drilling the holes for my gears and head
    piece so that it wouldn’t be slanted. They work better, but I still
    have to cut out my ⅛ in spacers so that the gears to hit gears on the other levels.
    I’m worried that the ⅛ in spacers won’t work though because I noticed that the ⅜ in spacers are actually a little less than ⅜ in.

  <h4> 11/27/17 (Free block)</h4>
  <p>I finished cutting out all my ⅛ in spacers and I finished assembling everything.
    It all runs smoothly, I just have to make sure that when I am glueing, I don’t make the layers
    to close together or else the friction would make the gears turn more slowly. I also have to take off all the plastic/ covering on the acrylic.

  <h4> 11/28/17 </h4>
  <p>I started working on the motor-run gear. I have to reprint a gear that will have a hole that will be wide
    enough for a dowel to go through and that dowel will have a cut in the middle that will go around the motor.
    I finished cutting the dowel, I just have to make the holes larger (in my acrylic piece for the heads) and cut out the gear.
    There was a line for the laser cutter so I was unable to cut the gear.

  <h4> 11/29/17 (Free block) </h4>
  <p>I cut out my gear and made sure that the dowel fits through the hole.
    I’m probably gonna finish drilling a hole in the other acrylic piece and then I will start peeling all
    the protective covering of the acrylic and start glueing everything.

  <h4> 11/30/17 </h4>
  <p>Today, I finished drilling the holes for the dowel (for the motor) for my acrylic head piece and I also drilled in the holes for
     the screw. Unfortunately, the holes were slightly off so the motor is off center. The dowel fits onto the motor, but there may be
      issues I have to fix in the future if it affects how smoothly the gears turn. Also, there is a strange thing that juts out of the
       bottom of the motor, so it is not flesh against the acrylic and that may mess up the angle of the motor.

    <h4> 12/4/17 </h4>
    <p>I started on the circuits part of my project and I have to start soldering a petrometer, power source,
      and power switch to my motor. I also ended up having to fix the center of my motor because it kept on
      pushing out the dowel. I created the depressions in my acrylic so that the screws would not hit the gears.

      <h4> 12/5/17 (Tutorial and Free block) </h4>
      <p>Tutorial: I finished soldering all my circuit parts together. I have a power switch, motor, and potentiometer.
        My potentiometer is 5k and it is too strong my motor, but the next smallest one is 100, so I’m going to use the 5k one, but it will just be very sensitive.
 <br> Free: I peeled off all the covering off my acrylic so hopefully, I can start assembling next class.
 I am scared that some certain gears may not fit with certain dowels.

        <h4> 12/6/17 </h4>
        <p>I’ve started to reassemble all my pieces. I also started to glue my gears together (the ones that would connect the different layers together.
          I also glued the certain spacers that should not move. In addition, I glued the gear to the dowel that is attached to the motor. I still have to
           glue the dowel to the motor though. Hopefully, I will be done gluing by next class and I will be able to start glueing the main acrylic enclosure pieces together.

          <h4> 12/8/17 </h4>
          <p>I finished gluing the motor gear. I tried to glue the motor gears with hot glue originally, but I found out that it wasn’t strong
             enough so I had to cut off the hot glue. I ended up gluing it with acrylic glue. I decided to be patient this time because if I rushed,
              I would risk gluing the dowel to the gears themselves. This ended up taking the whole block.

            <h4> 12/11/17 (Free block) </h4>
            <p>I attempted to glue my dowel and gear to the motor but I ended up breaking the dowel… TWICE! So I had to remake it twice.
              By the end of the block, I had remade it twice, but I ended up breaking it once more at the end of the block and accomplished nothing.
            </p>

              <h4> 12/12/17 </h4>
              <p>Today, I remade another dowel. I also got the new potentiometer and I resoldered everything. I decided to be more patient today,
                 so I superglued the dowel to the motor and I did not touch it until it is fully dried. Hopefully, this will prevent the dowel from
                  breaking yet again. If it does break, I will use a aluminum dowel instead.

                <h4> 12/13/17 (Finals Day) </h4>
                <p>I finally finished my project. :). I glued the gear to the dowel and had to make the hole for the dowel even larger
                  since it kept hitting the dowel. In addition, I found out that the reason there were issues when it was upright was
                  because of the gears that had no gears above it. Those gears would turn and slowly move away from the dowel. The gears would
                   eventually hit the gears that are in the upper layer. In addition, I accidentally broke my motor, so I had to tape it since the
                    solder is not fully connected. I glued all the sides together and ta-da, the project is finished.
                </p>
