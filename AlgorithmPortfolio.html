      <p>  I took this class during spring semester of junior year at Lick-Wilmerding High School. Lick Wilmerding High School - Technical Arts is a new course (first offered the year I took it)
        that is offered for one semester.  <br> <br>

        With a focus on CNC (computer numerically controlled) machines and 3D printing, while also using a variety of other tools, we looked at the ways that algorithmic design
        and mathematical patterns are  playing a role in the look and structure of such items as furniture, jewelry and architecture. This class looks at the application
        of math and algorithms in the process of designing modular objects and structures. Digital modeling, coding functions, and computer-driven tools are combined
        with some hand work in search of the ultimate combination of human and machine making.

         <br>
         <p> We immediately started working on this project as soon as the class begin. We were tasked to use a CNC machine to create an object with geometric shapes that represented who we were.
           I had multiple ideas, but I ended up choosing a design that looked like a diamond being held up by two horns. I chose to make the diamond shape because my birthday is in April and the
           birthstone for April is the diamond. I chose horns because I'm an Aries. For the sides, I choose two have 2 engraved clear acrylic, 2 engraved mirror, and 1 unengraved clear acyrlic. The reason
           for that is that I want to represent how there are parts of my identity that people can see, but there are many other aspects that people can't see. </p> <br>

             <tr>
               <th><p>The size of this prototype is ~1/2 the size of the actual piece. I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. The only thing I will change is probably the infill percentage
                 and the speed. Because the infill was lower and the speed was too fast, there were parts of the prototype were the material sagged. Also, there were a couple parts were the
                 PLA poked out. This was mainly caused by the speed. Even though this prototype was already much smaller than the original, it took ~3 hours. As a result, I anticipate that
                 I will have to 3d print the actual part overnight.</p></th>
               <th><p>The size of this prototype is to scale. I originally wanted this to be my final piece, but I noticed that there were certain things I wanted to change. One of those
                 being the tip: I plan to chop of the tip since it gets extremely thing at the top (thinner than the minimum width) which causes the filament to spew off to the sides. I
                 also want to add supports because the filaments, of the diamond where it spreads out, droops. Because of this, I would have to file away the strands and this would cause
                 the edge to not be flat/straight. I need to make sure that the edges are near perfect so that the acrylic can fit between the edges.</p></th>
               <th><p>After testing with v2, I discovered that the triangles are not all the same. As a result, I redesigned my rhino. I also printed my parts separately (top and bottom)
                 so that there will be no sagging since even though I printed with "Full Support", no supports were printed. Because I redesigned my file, the sides are a lot thinner. As
                 a result, it seems that every time I print it now, it lifts off the bed, ruining the print. I'm going to start using Simplify3d to hopefully avoid this.</p></th>

                  to use both mirror and clear acrylic. In the end, I decided that I would try to have 2 engraved mirror sides, 2 engraved clear sides, and 1 clear side. I decided to laser
                   cut a test piece to see how difficult it would be to see through the engravings. </p></th>
               <th><p>I tried cutting the clear acrylic but for some reason (though I used the same settings), the engraving cut through the acrylic. One of the reasons may be that the mirror
                  of the laser cutter was recently cleaned. I also found that the smoke caused the acrylic to brown. </p></th>

                  the machine to start spewing out filament in the wrong areas. I had to stop it prematurely,</p></th>
               <th><p>After seeing that I should add a raft, I did the same thing- adding full support and the raft this time. Unfortunately, I came in during lunch to check on it
                 and noticed that when the extruder passed over the top, the piece rocked back and forth. Turns out- the piece was detaching from the supports. As a result, I stopped
                  it and decided to reprint one horn at a time (on its side)</p></th>
               <th><p>While one of my prints was happening overnight, the power went off, stopping the print. When I came in this morning, we started to print a new one. Before I left
                 school, I noticed that there was no filament coming out. Turns out, the filament had been knotted and therefore, this print also had to be stopped. </p></th>

                 be because my print exceeded the max dimensions. As a result, this part is 85% of the original planned piece. The supports printed, but even then, the sides sagged a bit.
                  Because I didn't want to continue hogging the 3d printer, I decided to keep this as my final piece.</p></th>
               <th><p>I made almost no changes between prototype horn v3 and the final print. The only change was that the filament is white and the infill is 50%. Because the piece is
                 almost all solid, we didn't need the center to be so dense. We also changed to a newer roll of PLA to hopefully avoid the issue of knotting again. The difficult part was
                  just breaking away the support- I had to use some pliers to get the big chunks off than use 3 different sandpaper to smooth down the horns. </p></th>

           <h2> Logs: </h2>
           <h4> 1/28/19 </h4>
           <p> First day of class! I researched, thought of ideas, and sketched those ideas. I also finished the rhino design for idea #1. </p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 1/30/19 </h4>
           <p> Spent most of the class sharing and giving feedback on others' projects. I shared my idea #1, but I then spent class working on Idea #2. I finished the rhino design for Idea #2. </p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 2/1/19 </h4>
           <p> Spent the first half of class reviewing rhino and going over how to use the laser cutter and 3d printer. After, I finished finalizing my design
             and started prototyping, The prototype was scaled down so that it would take less time. Even then, it took ~3 hours.</p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 2/6/19 </h4>
           <p> 2/6: started 3d printing my actual base piece. Also ideated what I wanted my acrylic sides to look like; I decided to have 2 engraved mirror
             sides, 2 engraved clear sides, and 1 clear side. I also prototyped one of the engraved mirror sides.</p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 2/8/19 </h4>
           <p> Before the day started, I sent my file to be 3d printed. during class, we presented out prototypes to the class and got feedback.
             I was also able to start prototyping my acrylic sides. After some trials, I found that the triangles (which the acrylic would fit into)
             were not all the same sides. As a result, during D block, I remade the file, canceled my 3d print, and started a new 3d print. I also had some issues with engraving my acrylic.</p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 2/12/19 </h4>
           <p> 2/12: So my 3d printed piece didn't work again. I decided to move on so I started 3d printing my horns. I had to stop the cut
             twice- the first time, it didn't stick to the bed, causing it to spaghetti; the second time, the supports started breaking off,
             allowing the extruder to push the printed piece around. I had to ask Susa to help me with simplify3d since we had to add different supports.
             I also tried to use wolf to reprint my base piece but there seems to be something wrong with the gcode file.</p>
           <br>
           <hr>

           <h4> 2/14/19 </h4>
           <p> 2/14: Came to class and saw that both the base piece and one of the horns was done printing. The horn was successful,
             but there was still some sagging in the base piece. I also didn't know if I liked the smaller size of the base (i printed it smaller because
             I feared that it would go over the max dimensions). I then spent the remaining class printing the other horn and sanding down my other printed pieces.</p>
