     Hi, I'm Patricia Tse! <br> </h1>
    <p style="text-align: center; padding-left: 30%; padding-right: 30%; line-height: 20px;"> A senior at Lick-Wilmerding High School and Computer Scientist</p>

    <p style = "margin: 10%; margin-top:5%; font-size: 20px; font-family: 'Roboto Mono', monospace;"> San Franciscan. Student. Foodie. Guitarist. Pianist. Pun-lover. Arist.<br> <br>Having been born and raised in San-Francisco, I have always known about the tech bubble. Since I was very young, I knew that I wanted to become a scientist, engineer, or artist
     since I loved using my hands and creating things. It wasn't until 8th grade/freshman year that I realized that I wanted to be computer scientist. <br> <br>
    To me, computer science is a way for me to come with solutions to issues that plaque communities, whether big or large. The thing that draws me most to computer science, is that I can be part of
   the creative process of coming up with an idea, designing, programming, and testing. <br> <br> While I love coding, I also enjoy countless other hobbies such as art (digital and traditional), animating,
  photography, basketball, volleyball, swimming, guitar, piano, composing music, and video editing. </p>
