            <p> The Girls in Tech Club (GIT) was made to tackle the gender gap in STEM fields. Wanting to benefit the community,
                 we offered regular tech and programming workshops to people in our school community. As a club, we participated in the annual
                 Technovation Challenge, developing our programming skills as well as out marketing skills.
            </p>
            <p> I first started off being a club member of GIT. During my time as a club member, we competed in the 2018 Technovation Challenge,
                spending 4 months creating a business plan and developing a safety app that would alert contacts and authorities during an emergency
                 and designing the app logo using FireAlpaca and Krita. As a co-president of GIT, I facilitated weekly meetings, organized future
                 meetings and events, and designed coding workshops, leading a club of 10 high school girls.

                        , ranging from implemting hardware to designing a mobile app. Our team of 3, Tech4, designed an Android safety app, called SafeNet, made to tackle the common experience that many women face - feeling unsafe or threatened while commuting.
                        Out main goal was to empower people in our community and give them a peace of mind when they feel they may enter a threatening situation. While creating
                        our app, we were able to give a pitch to a team at Salesforce.
